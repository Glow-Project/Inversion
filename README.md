### Pantent troll

Don't be creative, honest, good but capitalistic, money-oriented and GET RICH!

- sue people for their inventions, win lawsuits
- buy good patents, sell bad ones
- open source patents to get higher karma
- bad karma means less potential regulations
- each law suit has a decision tree with propabilities to win
- a won law suit improves skill to increase probability to win more
- a deal lets you win almost any law suit but has low benefits
- like papers please
- software patents only? Websites/Forms with examples?

Patents:

- progress bar (see below)
- round edges
- patent games
- the 'F' key of any keyboard
- black-white image filter
- downloading a file
